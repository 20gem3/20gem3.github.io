# How I Learned to Design Ethically, Accessibly, and Effectively

At this point in my very short user-centered design career, I still would definitely not call myself an HCI expert. 
However, in the process of designing InterprArt, alongside Abby Miller and Maria Mejia, I have learned a lot about how to 
effectively design a product and have reshaped my mental model of what design actually is. At the beginning of this semester, 
I had absolutely no formal experience with design, in practice or in research. Through the process of designing an digital, 
auditory discussion board for use in a museum setting ( [link to InterprArt] (https://mc-mejia.github.io/HCIGroupProject/) ) in Professor Iris Howley’s Human Computer Interaction 
class at Williams College, I’ve been able to identify 5 key things to consider while designing.
