# How I Learned to Design Ethically, Accessibly, and Effectively

At this point in my very short user-centered design career, I still would definitely not call myself an HCI expert. 
However, in the process of designing InterprArt, alongside Abby Miller and Maria Mejia, I have learned a lot about how to 
effectively design a product and have reshaped my mental model of what design actually is. At the beginning of this semester, 
I had absolutely no formal experience with design, in practice or in research. Through the process of designing an digital, 
auditory discussion board for use in a museum setting ( [InterprArt](https://mc-mejia.github.io/HCIGroupProject/) ) in Professor Iris Howley’s Human Computer Interaction 
class at Williams College, I’ve been able to identify 5 key things to consider while designing.

## Five Principles That Define My Design Process

### 1. Ethics (Butterflies and Possible Uses)

As is the case for many ethical codes, including that of the Association for Computing Machinery, Do No Harm is the central tenet that guides my design process. I think about achieving this goal in two principle ways. The first, is to consider the “butterfly effect.”  In a world that has become increasingly interconnected due to technology and communication, it’s much easier for actions in one location to affect multiple groups that are seemingly separate (due to geographical distance, role in the community, ideology, etc.). Therefore, when considering whether to create a new technology, it’s important to wonder not only how it will affect the community that it is specifically designed for, but also groups of unexpected stakeholders. For example, while we did not implement our design in this class, and therefore did not spend a significant amount of time thinking about the specifics of hardware, there are serious ethical questions to raise in regard to the manufacturing practices of large tech companies. I was led to this concern after reading about the desperate and poorly paid Mechanical Turk workers, as I started thinking about fair compensation and work conditions link to article here. While both Apple and Microsoft have aesthetically pleasing and reassuring pages about responsible sourcing on their respective websites, ( [Apple](https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/responsible-sourcing)) both have been under scrutiny for the terrible work conditions in their manufacturing plants in China ([Apple Conditions](https://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-apple-china-workers-20180116-story.html) and [Microsoft Conditions](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-slammed-over-child-labor-accusations-2010-4) ). I realized that I need to think globally when I wonder about the ethical ramifications of my design.

Next, I try to remind myself that I cannot control the users who will interact with a potential technology. As quoted from Jurassic Park in class, “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.” No matter how I intend my project to be used, ultimately, the users are in control of what they do with it. Therefore, thinking of all potential uses is key to ethical design. As part of our class work, we read about artificial intelligence research being applied to [drone strikes](https://glow.williams.edu/files/133121246/download?download_frd=1). AI is a perfect example of a technology that could be used to do a lot of good, but also has tremendous capacity to do great harm. Once a technology leaves the hands of the designer, the designer loses control over how it is used.
Even when designing a product as seemingly innocuous as InterprArt, a digital, auditory discussion board for museums, considering these heavy ethical principles is important. A question that came up for us in the design process was, “What if user post profane  or offensive comments?” Realistically this is a very real possibility, and it is our responsibility as the designers to put measures in place to prevent the harm that could be caused by posts like these. In our case, we decided that either human or AI moderators should screen the submitted posts before they are made public.

### 2. Accessibility (Inclusivity, Inspiration, and Logistics)

InterprArt’s audio-based design is inherently inclusive of vision impaired users. This idea was inspired by Lester Lee, Karl Bocker, and Alyssa Wang’s design for their app, [Pin](http://www.lester-lee.com/curious-places/).

To be completely honest, we did not make this design decision due to accessibility concerns, but rather due to the logistics of a museum environment. It was only after learning more about accessibility that we made the connection that an auditory experience makes a museum visit more inclusive of vision impaired users. With accessibility on the forefront of our mind, we started wondering how we could intentionally increase the inclusivity of our design. After reading a 2014 paper by Chen, Grossman, Wigdor, and Fitzmaurice, I was intrigued by the possibility of phone and smartwatch integration.

With the larger screen of the phone, we could more easily add a more traditional written discussion board in compliment to our auditory design and increase accessibility beyond vision impaired users to deaf users and users with low mobility, for whom interacting with the smartwatch poses a challenge. Ultimately, my group did not make these changes because were at such a late stage in the design process. Adding a smartphone feature would mean completely overhauling certain aspects of our design, and we did not have user data to back up this choice. From these experiences, I learned two main things regarding accessibility. First, that it’s extremely important to keep up to date on the literature and what other designers are doing. Inspiration can come from anywhere, and if I had simply relied on my own thinking process, without consulting research and past designs, these ideas may never have occurred to me. And second, that accessibility concerns need to be integrated into the design process from the very beginning. If we had set out to create an accessible design from the outset, rather than contemplating how to make a design more accessible after the fact, we would have been much more successful.
